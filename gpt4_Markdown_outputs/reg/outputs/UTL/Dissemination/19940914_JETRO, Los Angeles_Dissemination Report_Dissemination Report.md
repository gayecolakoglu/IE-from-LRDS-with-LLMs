By visiting the JETRO Business Information Desk, exporters interested in entering the Japanese market can utilize JETRO's in-house computer database service known as "T.O.P.S.". The service, which stands for Trade Opportunity Service, is specifically designed to identify and introduce potential Japanese trade partners to foreign exporters.

All business executives wanting to use the service must complete a T.O.P.S. application, which asks for company information and details of the product to be exported to Japan. Thereafter, JETRO will match the exporter's needs to appropriate import-oriented companies in Japan using the extensive T.O.P.S. database.

Through this search-and-match process, selected Japanese firms will receive the foreign exporter's information via JETRO's nationwide online network. A final listing of all the Japanese companies that received the product information is presented to the foreign exporter.

To begin your Export to Japan Partnership, visit the JETRO Business Information Desk and establish contacts with Japanese firms without ever leaving the country.

STAY ON TOP OF YOUR BUSINESS
POTENTIAL IN JAPAN, USE JETRO T.O.P.S.!
