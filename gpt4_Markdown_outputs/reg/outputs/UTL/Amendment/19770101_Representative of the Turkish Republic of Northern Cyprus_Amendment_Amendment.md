Two letters were written in response to articles appearing in the Chicago Daily News and the Time Herald Record, an Orange County New York State Daily newspaper. Both letters were published in said newspapers. My purpose in writing the first letter (Chicago Daily News) was to dispute the allegations by Cypriot Ambassador, N.G. Dimitriou in which the Turkish intervention on Cyprus was characterized as aggression. My interest in writing this letter was to present to this newspaper and its readers the view that this intervention was in the interest of maintaining peace on Cyprus and safeguard the considerable Turkish Cypriot population on Cyprus. It is my desire to present to the American public the complete truth concerning the Cyprus question which truth cannot be obtained by reading articles presenting on the Greek side of the question.

The second letter (Times Herald Record) was written to present first an accurate number of displaced Greek Cypriots i.e. 90,000 not 200,000. The fact that partial resettlement of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots has been implemented and finally that the mention of NATO arms used by the Turkish forces was no better or worse than the NATO arms used by the Greek forces a fact not mentioned.

Neither letter which when published resulted in "articles" was written with the intention of changing and/or influencing official U.S. policy except where said policy is made or changed as a result of policy makers possessing the complete facts concerning a very serious problem confronting all Cypriots be they of Greek or Turkish ancestry.
